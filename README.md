This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Before deploying, add these environment variables in the Vercel project settings for the deployment target:

- `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL`: the pooled PostgreSQL connection string
- `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`: the direct PostgreSQL connection string used by Prisma migrations

Both variables are required during the build because API routes initialize Prisma while Next.js collects route data. If you use Vercel Postgres or Neon, copy the corresponding values from that integration. After saving them, redeploy the project. Do not commit these connection strings; keep local values in `.env.local`.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
